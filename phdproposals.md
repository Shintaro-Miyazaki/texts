## Readme before you submit a PhD proposal

I am honored, that you want to pursue a PhD under my supervision and I am looking very much forward to learning from you and together with you. At this point we have already exchanged some emails or even had a conversation. I decided to write this document, in order to make our communication more efficient and transparent. 

1. make sure that you have made you familiar with the "Promotionsordnung". It is the formal, bureaucratic framework for your PhD. 
2. prepare to write an expose or "research proposal" of a maximum ten pages. Make youself familiar with the writing style and style of argumentation adequate for this "genre". Essential sections are: Summary; research question; current state of research (and how you relate to it); methods, milestones and project plan, relevance/impact and bibliography.   
3. make yourself familiar with some of my [scholarly work (scroll further below)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7922-735X). Try to refer to it and position yourself towards it.. A fast entry provides my article on [algorhythmics](http://computationalculture.net/algorhythmics-understanding-micro-temporality-in-computational-cultures/) from 2012. 
4. make sure that you know about the current state of research concerning your topic. Coming along with your specific topic you should become also familiar with the fields I am working in such as media studies, critical code, algorithm and software studies, media archaeology, Marxist studies of digitality/ information technology etc. 
5. to have a common basis please read and work through the following texts: 1). [Jussi Parikka, To Media Study: Media Studies and Beyond (2020)](https://mast-nemla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MAST_Vol1_No1.pdf). 2). [Jentery Sayers, Studying Media Through New Media (2018)](https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:19696/datastreams/CONTENT/content). 3). Mitchell, W.J.T./ Mark B.N. Hansen. „Introduction“. In [Critical Terms for Media Studies (2010).](https://www.bibliovault.org/BV.landing.epl?ISBN=9780226532554) And follow the threads mentioned there according to your interests. Read some more chapters (they are all very valuable) such as "information" "technology" "networks" "software/hardware/wetware". 4). at least two or three works by the great German media studies scholar Friedrich Kittler, I recommend, "[There is no software](http://raley.english.ucsb.edu/wp-content/Engl800/Kittler-nosoftware.pdf)", "[Protected mode](https://monoskop.org/images/1/1f/Kittler_Friedrich_1997_Protected_Mode.pdf)" and "[Time-Axis-Manipulation](https://doi.org/10.1215/17432197-3755144)". Along with an [introduction](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0263276414567836) written 2015 by Jussi Parikka and Paul Feigelfeld. 
6. write and finalize a proposal for your PhD-research project (we can do this together to some degree, but it usually takes some months to develop and finalize such a proposal.) In the "current state of research" section refer to the literature mentioned above and position yourself. Refer to other sources and methods according to your interests. Send it to me. I will review it. 

When all this is fullfilled and I accept the proposal, then I can sign your "Application for admission to doctoral studies" and support you for all matters related to your PhD research.
